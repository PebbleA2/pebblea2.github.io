Hello! :bowtie:  Welcome to the very quick-and-dirty **PebbleA2** site that I just threw together a moment ago with the hope of planting a seed from which a local Pebble community might grow! :blush:  

Who am I?  You can call me [@ishotjr](https://github.com/ishotjr), or [@IshJr](https://twitter.com/IShJR) for short! :grinning:  I'm a huge Pebble enthusiast - I [backed the original](http://ishotjr.com/pebble-digital-watches-are-a-pretty-neat-idea/), as well as the [Time](https://twitter.com/IShJR/status/570245832022208514), and recently, the [Time 2 and Core](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/597507018/pebble-2-time-2-and-core-an-entirely-new-3g-ultra).  I dabbled with earlier versions of the SDK, but got [really into Pebble development](http://ishotjr.com/tag/pw-dos/) while waiting for my Time to arrive.  I [built a working smartstrap](https://twitter.com/IShJR/status/638181644566949893) before the SDK to support it had even been released, and, with the brilliant [@racerx](https://github.com/racerx), went on to [win the hackathon](https://twitter.com/HackDads/status/640749685955629056) at which it [was announced](http://pebblerocksboulder.com/).  Since then, I've made various [silly smartstraps](http://ishotjr.github.io/2015/11/29/pw-dos-touchscreen-keyboard-pebble-smartstrap.html), and occasionally even [something useful](https://github.com/ishotjr/rephone-smartstrap/wiki) - oh, and recently won [another hackathon](https://twitter.com/IShJR/status/716736028271329281) with teammate [@robisodd](https://github.com/robisodd).  At the recent Ottawa event, I had a chance to experience the vibrant Pebble community that has formed there, and it inspired me to attempt to create something similar in Ann Arbor. :triumph:  

I've set an extremely tentative date and time for our initial meeting:  

***7pm on Wednesday, June 29th, at [HopCat in Ann Arbor](http://hopcat.com/ann-arbor)***

This is just an initial suggestion to be iterated upon - get in touch via [@PebbleA2](https://twitter.com/PebbleA2) with thoughts, suggestions, conflicts, etc. - there's still plenty of room for tweaks at this point! :bowtie: :thought_balloon: :calendar:  

The initial meeting will be a casual get-together where we can survey the local Pebble landscape, share projects and experiences, and talk about how to get started with Pebble development, for those who are interested.  :neckbeard: :computer: :watch:
